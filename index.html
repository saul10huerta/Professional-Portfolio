                <div class="section-text">
                    <p>Attended the University of Texas at Austin where I earned a BSA in Biology as well as certificates in both Business and Health Information Technology. In addition, I’m currently enrolled in UT Austin coding bootcamp working to be a full stack web developer. Will be earning a certificate from this bootcamp in October 2020.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I currently work as a Business Analyst Consultant for eClinicalWorks implementing medical practices of various sizes with eCW Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Practice Management (PM) system from project initiation to application deployment. I also help optimize practices who typically have been live with eCW EHR & PM for a few years. I’ve worked for this company since 2017, as a software trainer for the first 8 months, and now as BA.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer throughout the year in competitive leagues, running, and hiking the trails in Austin. I also try to travel regularly to places like Puerto Vallarta, Mexico for vacation, and to visit family in different parts in Mexico and California.</p>
